# Oracle Integration Guide

This document describes the current oracle architecture used by Checkmate
Escrow. It explains the two distinct on-chain oracle components and how they
work together with the off-chain oracle service.

The current design has:
- an `EscrowContract` that stores a trusted `oracle` address and authorises
  result submissions for on-chain payout,
- an `OracleContract` that stores an independent, auditable copy of verified
  match results.

The escrow contract uses its configured oracle address as the authoritative
permission for submitting results to trigger payouts. The oracle contract is
supplementary: it does not authorise escrow payouts or act as a gatekeeper for
escrow result submission. It provides an audit log and an independent on-chain
record of results that can be queried later.

The off-chain oracle service today is the trusted operator that:
1. verifies the platform result for `game_id` using an external chess API,
2. calls `EscrowContract::submit_result(match_id, winner)` from the escrow-side
   oracle address,
3. records the same result in `OracleContract` for auditing and optional
   verification.


The two contracts are separate:
- `EscrowContract` enforces match state, funding, and oracle address
  authentication.
- `OracleContract` enforces admin-only result storage and exposes public or
  admin-gated read interfaces.

## game_id Format

The `game_id` field is a platform-specific string that uniquely identifies a
chess game. It is supplied when creating a match and must be passed to the
oracle when submitting a result. The oracle uses it to look up the game outcome
via the platform's public API.

### Lichess

Lichess game IDs are **8-character alphanumeric strings** (case-sensitive,
lowercase letters and digits).

They appear in the game URL:

```
https://lichess.org/abcd1234
                    ^^^^^^^^
                    game_id = "abcd1234"
```

Example API call the oracle makes:

```
GET https://lichess.org/game/export/abcd1234
```

Valid example: `"abcd1234"`  
Invalid examples: `"ABCD1234"` (uppercase), `"abcd123"` (7 chars), `""` (empty)

### Chess.com

Chess.com game IDs are **numeric strings**, typically 7–12 digits, found in the live game URL:

```
https://www.chess.com/game/live/123456789
                                ^^^^^^^^^
                                game_id = "123456789"
```

Example API call the oracle makes:

```
GET https://api.chess.com/pub/game/123456789
```

Valid example: `"123456789"`
Invalid examples: `"abc"` (non-numeric), `""` (empty)

## Game ID Formats

| Platform   | Format                        | Example         | Validation Rule                                      |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Lichess    | 8-character alphanumeric      | `abcd1234`      | Exactly 8 chars; lowercase letters and digits only   |
| Chess.com  | Numeric string (7–12 digits)  | `123456789`     | Digits only; no letters or special characters        |

All game IDs are subject to a maximum length of **64 bytes** (`MAX_GAME_ID_LEN`). Submissions exceeding this limit are rejected on-chain with `Error::InvalidGameId` before any off-chain lookup is attempted.

---

## Validation Rules

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| Max length | 64 bytes (`MAX_GAME_ID_LEN`). Enforced on-chain — `create_match` returns `Error::InvalidGameId` if exceeded. |
| Uniqueness | Each `game_id` can only be used once. A duplicate returns `Error::DuplicateGameId`. |
| Format | Not validated on-chain. Passing a malformed ID will cause the oracle to fail result lookup off-chain. |
| Platform match | The `platform` field must match the source of the `game_id`. Mismatches are not caught on-chain but will cause oracle verification to fail. |

---

## Submitting a Result

Once a game is finished, the off-chain oracle service verifies the result via
an external chess platform API and then submits the verified outcome to the
escrow contract from the configured oracle address.

```rust
// Winner::Player1 | Winner::Player2 | Winner::Draw
escrow_client.submit_result(&match_id, &winner);
```

That escrow submission is the authoritative payout trigger. The escrow contract
trusts only its configured oracle address when authorising `submit_result`.

Separately, the oracle service records the same result in the on-chain
`OracleContract` for auditability and later verification.

```rust
oracle_client.submit_result(&match_id, &game_id, &MatchResult::Player1Wins);
```

For tournament support, the oracle contract also exposes a batch API:
`submit_batch_results`. This lets the oracle submit 10–100 verified match
results in a single atomic transaction.

---

## Chess.com API Rate Limits, Timeouts, and Offline Fallback

The off-chain Chess.com client (see `oracle-service/src/oracle/chess_com_client.rs`) must obey Chess.com’s public API limits:

- **Rate limit:** **30 requests / minute** (≈ 1 request / 2 seconds, globally).
- **Timeout:** **30 seconds max** per HTTP request.

### Rate limiting behavior

The oracle client uses a client-side rate limiter. If a request would exceed the quota, it waits until tokens are available before issuing the HTTP call.

### Error handling rules

If Chess.com returns:
- **404:** treat as `GameNotFound` (invalid game id or unavailable game).
- **non-2xx:** treat as `HttpStatus` and retry using the oracle service’s retry strategy (if any).
- **timeouts / network errors:** treat as transient; retry with exponential backoff.

### Offline fallback strategy

When Chess.com is unreachable or rate-limited:
- **Do not submit** an on-chain result until a verified end-state is fetched.
- Mark the match as **pending verification** and retry later.
- If a verification attempt observes a game payload without a known terminal
  `end.result`, treat it as **GameNotFinished** and retry.

---

## Oracle Submission Rate Limiting

To prevent spam or denial-of-service against the on-chain oracle log, the
`OracleContract` enforces per-oracle submission limits on `submit_result` and
`submit_batch_results`:

| Limit | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Hourly | 100 submissions | Rolling 1-hour window |
| Daily | 1,000 submissions | Rolling 24-hour window |

A `submit_batch_results` call counts its full entry count against both limits
in a single check — e.g. a 40-entry batch consumes 40 units of quota. The
check runs before any storage writes, so a rejected call (whole batch or
single result) never partially succeeds and never consumes quota.

### Sliding window algorithm

Limits are tracked with a sliding-window counter rather than a naive fixed
window, so a burst spanning a window boundary can't double the effective
limit. Each window (hourly, daily) stores:

- `window_start` — the timestamp (`env.ledger().timestamp()`) the current
  window began,
- `current_count` — submissions recorded since `window_start`,
- `previous_count` — submissions recorded in the window immediately before.

The estimated count for rate-limit purposes is:

```
estimate = current_count + previous_count * (window_size - elapsed_in_current) / window_size
```

This weights the previous window's count by how much of it still falls inside
the trailing lookback period, giving an accurate approximation of a true
sliding window without storing a timestamp per submission.

### Admin configuration

The admin can override the default limits per oracle address:

```rust
oracle_client.set_oracle_rate_limits(&oracle_address, &hourly_limit, &daily_limit);
```

- Passing `0` for either field resets that field to the contract default
  (100/1000).
- `hourly_limit` must not exceed `daily_limit` (when both are non-zero), or
  the call returns `Error::InvalidRateLimit`.
- Emits an `oracle / ratelim` event with `(oracle, hourly_limit, daily_limit)`.

### Querying rate limit status

There is no HTTP layer on-chain, so instead of rate-limit response headers,
callers query current usage directly:

```rust
let status = oracle_client.get_oracle_rate_limit_status(&oracle_address);
// status.hourly_used / .hourly_limit / .hourly_remaining
// status.daily_used  / .daily_limit  / .daily_remaining

let limits = oracle_client.get_oracle_rate_limits(&oracle_address);
// limits.hourly_limit / .daily_limit
```

### Suspicious pattern alerts

Once an oracle's usage reaches **80%** of either its hourly or daily limit,
the contract emits an `oracle / alert` event with
`(oracle, window_label, used, limit)`, where `window_label` is `"hourly"` or
`"daily"`. Off-chain monitoring can subscribe to this event to page an admin
before the oracle is actually throttled.

### Errors

- `Error::RateLimitExceeded` (9) — the submission(s) would exceed the
  oracle's hourly or daily limit.
- `Error::InvalidRateLimit` (10) — `set_oracle_rate_limits` was called with
  `hourly_limit > daily_limit`.

---

## Result Deletion Policy (`delete_result`)

The oracle contract exposes a `delete_result` function that allows the admin to remove a previously submitted result from persistent storage:

```rust
oracle_client.delete_result(&match_id); // → Result<(), Error>
```

### Why it exists

On-chain persistent storage has a finite TTL (~30 days). In normal operation results expire naturally. `delete_result` exists for two narrow operational cases:

1. **Erroneous submission** — the oracle submitted a result for the wrong `match_id` (e.g., due to a bug or misconfiguration) before the escrow payout was triggered. Deletion allows the correct result to be re-submitted.
2. **Storage reclamation** — proactively freeing storage rent for results that are no longer needed (e.g., after a dispute is fully resolved off-chain).

## Troubleshooting

### Rate limit exceeded (`RateLimitExceeded`)

**Symptom:** `submit_result` or `submit_batch_results` returns
`Error(Contract, #9)`.

**Cause:** The oracle has exhausted its hourly (100) or daily (1,000)
submission quota on the `OracleContract`.

**Fix:**
- Wait until the rolling window resets (up to 1 hour for hourly, 24 hours for
  daily).
- Query current usage before retrying:
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ORACLE \
    -- get_oracle_rate_limit_status --oracle <ORACLE_ADDRESS>
  ```
- If the default limits are too low for your workload, the admin can raise
  them:
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ORACLE \
    --source <ORACLE_ADMIN_KEYPAIR> \
    -- set_oracle_rate_limits \
    --oracle <ORACLE_ADDRESS> \
    --hourly_limit 500 \
    --daily_limit 5000
  ```

---

### API key invalid / authentication failure

**Symptom:** The off-chain oracle service logs `401 Unauthorized` or
`403 Forbidden` when calling the chess platform API.

**Cause:** `LICHESS_API_TOKEN` or `CHESSDOTCOM_API_KEY` in `.env` is missing,
expired, or incorrect.

**Fix:**
1. Re-generate or copy the correct key from your Lichess/Chess.com developer
   account.
2. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   LICHESS_API_TOKEN=lip_xxxxxxxxxxxx
   CHESSDOTCOM_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
3. Restart the oracle service. No on-chain changes are required.

---

### Game not finished yet (`GameNotFinished`)

**Symptom:** The oracle service logs `GameNotFinished` and does not submit a
result; the match stays `Active` on-chain.

**Cause:** The chess platform API returned a game payload without a terminal
`end.result` field — the game is still in progress.

**Fix:** This is expected behaviour. The oracle will retry automatically. No
manual intervention is needed unless the game has genuinely ended but the
platform API is lagging. In that case:
- Wait a few minutes and allow the retry backoff to resolve it.
- If the platform API continues to show the game as in progress after it has
  clearly ended, contact the platform's support or wait for the result to
  propagate (usually < 5 minutes).

---

### Network timeout / chess platform unreachable

**Symptom:** Oracle service logs `timeout`, `connection refused`, or
`HttpStatus` errors; no result is submitted on-chain.

**Cause:** The chess platform API is temporarily unreachable, or the 30-second
HTTP timeout was exceeded.

**Fix:**
- The oracle will not submit a result until a verified end-state is confirmed.
  Retry is automatic with exponential backoff.
- Check the platform's status page ([lichess.org/status](https://lichess.org/status)
  or [chess.com](https://www.chess.com)) for ongoing incidents.
- Verify outbound connectivity from the oracle host:
  ```bash
  curl -I https://lichess.org/game/export/abcd1234
  curl -I https://api.chess.com/pub/game/123456789
  ```
- If the oracle host is behind a firewall, ensure outbound HTTPS (port 443) is
  open to the chess platform domains.

---

### Oracle not submitting results (wrong oracle address configured)

**Symptom:** `submit_result` returns `UnauthorizedOracle`; the transaction is
signed by the oracle keypair but still rejected.

**Cause:** The escrow contract's stored oracle address does not match the
keypair the oracle service is using.

**Fix:** Check which address the escrow contract has on record:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ESCROW -- get_oracle
```
Compare this to the oracle service's configured keypair address. If they
differ, either:
- Update the oracle service's keypair to match the on-chain address, or
- Rotate the on-chain oracle address (requires escrow admin):
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ESCROW \
    --source <ESCROW_ADMIN_KEYPAIR> \
    -- update_oracle \
    --new_oracle <CORRECT_ORACLE_ADDRESS>
  ```
